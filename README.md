# VMMReadout

This is a (pseudo-)mirror of the NSWELX Readout\_Software repository [here](https://svnweb.cern.ch/cern/wsvn/NSWELX) basically to avoid dealing with SVN so much which has no concept of collaborative code development.

To checkout the trunk of the NSWELs Readout\_Software repo:

```
svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/NSWELX/Readout_Software/trunk
```
